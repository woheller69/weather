RadarWeather lets you watch the weather for cities and locations you are interested in.

Weather data is provided via the free API from OpenWeatherMap. As the new One Call API allows only 1000 calls per day, every user must enter his own free OpenWeatherMap key (https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). 
Data for the rain radar is retrieved via the free RainViewer API.
